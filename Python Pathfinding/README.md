# Python Pathfinding

### MapDataSubmarine.py

A utility written to record current player world location to a file. Uses module.cpp written in Memory Reading directory. Please understand
how to use memory "hacking" properly before using. 

### MapGeneratorSubmarine.py

"This converts the data collected from MapDataSubmarine into a HUGE list"... apparently.

### PathFinding.py 

Full algorithm implementation with a visual aspect as well as interfacing with the coordinates gathered from the previous two tools. Modifying
this back to vanilla A* should not be too hard.
